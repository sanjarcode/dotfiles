# spec-kitty-mission-review

You are the expert senior reviewer for a completed Spec Kitty mission. The
mission has been fully implemented, all WPs have been approved, and the feature
branch has been merged. Your job is to answer a single question with documented
evidence: **does the merged code accurately and completely realize the spec, and
are there risks the implementation team did not surface?**

This is not a checklist exercise. It is structured adversarial analysis. You
read the spec as the author's promise and the code as the executor's delivery,
and you measure the gap. Every finding you produce must be traceable to an
artifact (a spec section, a git diff line, a test file, a contract clause). You
do not fix anything. You document.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- After `spec-kitty merge --mission <slug>` completes and all WPs show `done`
- Before tagging a release that depends on this mission's changes
- When a downstream team needs a sign-off on spec→code fidelity
- When you suspect a WP review was too narrow and cross-WP holes exist
- As the "accept" gate in a mission lifecycle

---

## Step 1: Orient — Load Mission Identity and Status

Before reading a single line of code, anchor yourself to what the mission
promised and where it stands.

```bash
# Confirm the mission is fully merged (all WPs must be done)
spec-kitty agent tasks status --mission <slug>
```

If any WP is not in `done`, this is not a post-merge mission review — use
`spec-kitty-runtime-review` instead.

```bash
# Read the mission identity
cat kitty-specs/<slug>/meta.json
```

Note the `baseline_merge_commit` (the SHA of the PR that preceded this mission,
if present) and `mission_type`. These anchor every git diff you will run.

```bash
# Scan the event log for the full state machine history
cat kitty-specs/<slug>/status.events.jsonl
```

The event log tells you: how many rejection cycles each WP had, which WPs were
forced (unusual transitions that bypassed normal flow), and whether any WPs
were approved by arbiter override rather than clean review. A WP with 3+
rejection cycles that ended in an arbiter-forced approval is a high-priority
target for your analysis — the disagreement history is a signal.

---

## Step 2: Absorb the Full Mission Contract

You cannot review what you do not understand. Read the full specification and
all contract artifacts before looking at code.

```bash
# The specification: goals, non-goals, locked decisions, FRs, NFRs, constraints
cat kitty-specs/<slug>/spec.md

# The technical design per track
cat kitty-specs/<slug>/plan.md

# The WP breakdown: subtasks, FR references, DoD per WP, FR coverage table
cat kitty-specs/<slug>/tasks.md

# Acceptance test scenarios (canonical test contract layer)
cat kitty-specs/<slug>/contracts/test-contracts.md

# CLI behavior contracts (what commands must and must not do)
cat kitty-specs/<slug>/contracts/cli-contracts.md

# File format contracts (schema expectations, migration story)
cat kitty-specs/<slug>/contracts/file-format-contracts.md
```

As you read, build a mental model of:

1. **What the spec explicitly forbids** (Non-Goals and "MUST NOT" clauses) — these
   are the easiest violations to detect and the most expensive to have shipped.
2. **What the spec locks** (Decisions) — any code that re-opens a locked decision
   is a drift finding regardless of whether the code "works".
3. **What the spec assumes but never states** ("invisible holes") — read Goals and
   Acceptance Criteria looking for implicit assumptions. For example, a goal
   that says "a fresh install works" assumes the version in `metadata.yaml`
   matches `pyproject.toml` — but if the spec never stated that as an FR, no
   test will catch it. These are your highest-value findings.

---

## Step 3: Load the Git Timeline

Establish a clean baseline-to-HEAD picture. Every code change since baseline
is the implementation's evidence. Anything in the spec that produced no diff
is suspect.

```bash
# What changed since the baseline commit?
# Use baseline_merge_commit from meta.json
git log <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD --oneline

# Summary of changed files — use this to build your review coverage map
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD --stat

# Full diff (for large missions, scope by directory first)
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- src/
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- tests/
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- docs/
```

Build a **coverage map** from the diff stat: which files changed, and which
spec tracks they correspond to. Then invert the map: are there files that a
spec track required to change that do NOT appear in the diff? Missing changes
are often more important than the changes that exist.

For each WP, cross-reference owned files from its frontmatter:

```bash
# Read each WP's owned_files declaration
cat kitty-specs/<slug>/tasks/WP01-*.md | head -40
```

Then verify the claimed owned files actually appear in the diff:

```bash
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- <owned_file_path>
```

A WP that declares ownership of a file that shows no diff is either incomplete
or its work was done in a different file than declared. Determine which.

---

## Step 4: Read the WP Review History

The WP review cycle files are a goldmine of documented problems. Every issue a
per-WP reviewer raised is a partial constraint on what was shipped. Your job is
to verify resolutions, not re-do the work.

```bash
# For each WP that had review cycles, read all cycle files
ls kitty-specs/<slug>/tasks/WP*/
cat kitty-specs/<slug>/tasks/WP01-*/review-cycle-*.md
cat kitty-specs/<slug>/tasks/WP02-*/review-cycle-*.md
# ... repeat for each WP
```

For each rejection cycle, identify:

- **What was flagged**: the blocking issues
- **What was promised**: the fix summary / remediation
- **What actually shipped**: verify against the diff

Issues that were flagged but then "resolved" via a forced approval or an arbiter
override warrant special scrutiny. Read the git commit that fixed each blocker:

```bash
# Find the commit message that addressed a specific review issue
git log --oneline --all | grep -i "WP0X"
git show <commit_sha> -- <file_flagged_in_review>
```

Deferred issues are a category of their own. A review cycle may have closed
with "deferred to follow-up issue #NNN" — if that deferral is not documented
anywhere post-merge (no GitHub issue, no CHANGELOG note), it is a silent
hole in the delivery.

---

## Step 5: FR Trace — Each FR from Spec to Test to Code

This is the core of the review. For every Functional Requirement, you need
a closed chain: **spec stated it → WP owned it → test verifies it → code
implements it**. A chain with any broken link is a finding.

Start from the FR coverage table in `tasks.md`:

```
| WP    | Spec FRs |
|-------|---------|
| WP01  | FR-001, FR-002, FR-003, ... |
```

For each FR:

```bash
# 1. Find the test(s) for this FR
grep -r "FR-NNN\|T<track>.<n>" tests/ --include="*.py" -l

# 2. Read the test — does it actually test what the FR requires?
# (Not just name it in a comment)
grep -n "FR-NNN" tests/<relevant_test_file>.py -A 10

# 3. Find the code that satisfies the FR
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- src/ | grep -A 10 -B 5 "<key_symbol>"
```

The question for each test is not "does the test pass?" (you can assume it
does — the mission merged). The question is: **does the test actually constrain
the behavior the FR requires?**

A test that creates a synthetic fixture with `status: done` in frontmatter
when real status is stored in `status.events.jsonl` does not test what the FR
requires. It tests an imagined model that does not exist in production. This is
the "passing test, failing system" failure mode.

For every FR that maps to a test, ask: if someone deleted the implementation
code this test is supposed to cover, would the test fail? If the answer is "no,
the test would still pass because it uses a synthetic fixture," the test is a
false positive and the FR is effectively untested in production.

---

## Step 6: Drift and Gap Analysis

After the FR trace, step back and look at the mission as a whole. Drift is
when the implementation deviates from what the spec locked. Gaps are things the
spec required that no WP delivered.

### Non-goal invasion

Re-read every Non-Goal (NG-N). Then search the diff for anything that touches
the territory those non-goals define:

```bash
# Example: if NG-2 says "no backfill of historical missions"
# Search for any code that iterates existing kitty-specs/
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- src/ | grep -n "kitty-specs\|missions_dir\|glob\|walk"
```

Code that touches out-of-scope territory is either a scope violation or needs
clear justification in the review record. Absent documentation, assume violation.

### Locked decision violations

For each locked Decision (D-N), identify the key invariant it establishes. Then
grep for code patterns that contradict it:

```bash
# Example: D-1 says "init MUST NOT initialize git, under any flag combination"
# Verify no git init call paths remain
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- src/ | grep -n "git init\|init_git_repo\|subprocess.*git"
```

Locked decisions often have both positive requirements (the new behavior) and
negative requirements (the forbidden old behavior). Reviewers frequently verify
the positive side and forget the negative side. Verify both.

### Punted FRs

Cross-reference the FR list with the test files. An FR that appears in
`tasks.md`'s requirements coverage table but produces no `grep` hit in `tests/`
is a punted FR:

```bash
# For each FR-NNN in spec.md, check test coverage
grep -r "FR-NNN" tests/ --include="*.py" -l
```

A punted FR that was marked "Proposed" in the spec and never upgraded to
"Approved" in plan review is documentation drift only. A punted FR that was
marked "Approved" (accepted into the delivery contract) with no test coverage
is a delivery gap.

### NFR verification

For each Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) with a measurable threshold:

```bash
# Example: NFR-004 — new tests < 60s in aggregate
# Count new test files and estimate
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD --stat | grep "tests/"

# Example: NFR-006 — project type-checking clean
# Check if any type-check suppression directives were added
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- src/ | grep -n "type: ignore\|noqa"
```

Pay particular attention to performance NFRs — they rarely have automated
enforcement and are easy to skip.

---

## Step 7: Risk Identification

This step requires active adversarial imagination. You are looking for things
that could go wrong that neither the spec nor the WP reviews anticipated.

### Boundary conditions

For every "MUST NOT happen under any flag combination" clause in the spec, the
implementation will have conditional logic to enforce it. Find that logic and
ask: is there a code path that bypasses the condition?

```bash
# Find all conditional branches near a key enforced behavior
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- src/<key_file>.py | grep -B 5 -A 10 "if\|else\|try\|except"
```

The most common boundary failure: a guard that protects the "happy path" but
has an exception handler that silently re-enables the forbidden behavior.

### Error paths

For every new function introduced by this mission, trace what happens when it
fails. An error path that silently swallows exceptions and returns `None` or `""`
is a silent failure candidate:

```bash
# Find all try/except blocks in new code
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- src/ | grep -n "except\|raise\|log\."
```

The pattern to look for: `try: <critical operation> except Exception: pass` or
`except Exception: return ""`. A function that returns an empty string when
something goes wrong (e.g., a function that builds a changelog block) will pass
its tests but produce wrong output in production. This is the "silent empty
result" anti-pattern.

### Dead code

A module with passing tests but no callers from live entry points is dead code.
The most common post-merge defect in this codebase:

```bash
# For every new module/class introduced, verify at least one live caller
# Example: verify new module is imported from live command path
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- src/ | grep "^+.*def \|^+.*class " | head -30
```

For each new public function or class:

```bash
grep -r "from.*<new_module> import\|import <new_module>" src/ --include="*.py"
```

Zero grep hits on a new module from `src/` (not just from `tests/`) means the
feature is dead code, regardless of test coverage.

### Cross-WP integration gaps

Each WP was reviewed in isolation. The mission review is the first opportunity
to verify that all WPs integrate correctly. For missions with parallel WPs that
modified the same subsystem:

```bash
# Find files touched by multiple WPs (use owned_files from WP frontmatter)
# These are integration risk points
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- src/<shared_file>.py
```

Pay special attention to `__init__.py` exports — multiple parallel WPs
commonly introduce conflicts here that are resolved at merge time but may
drop an export.

---

## Step 8: Security Review

For missions that touch CLI input handling, file I/O, subprocess execution,
authentication, or network calls, perform a focused security pass.

```bash
# Find all subprocess calls introduced by this mission
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- src/ | grep -n "subprocess\|shell=True\|Popen\|run("

# Find all file path operations
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- src/ | grep -n "open(\|Path(\|os.path\|glob("

# Find all HTTP/network calls
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- src/ | grep -n "httpx\|requests\|urllib\|socket"

# Find all authentication / credential operations
git diff <baseline_merge_commit>..HEAD -- src/ | grep -n "credentials\|token\|password\|secret\|auth"
```

For each hit, ask:

- **CLI input validation**: Is user-supplied CLI argument used directly in a
  file path, subprocess command, or SQL-equivalent? Typer validation helps, but
  check that it is actually applied to the parameter being used.
- **Path traversal**: Any `Path(user_input)` that is not anchored to a known safe
  base directory (e.g., `tmp_path / user_input` without validation) can be
  exploited with `../../etc/passwd` style inputs.
- **Subprocess injection**: Any `shell=True` with dynamic content is a command
  injection risk. In a mission that modifies git operations, verify that branch
  names and commit messages are passed as list arguments, not formatted into a
  shell string.
- **Lock semantics**: For missions that touch file locking (e.g., auth refresh
  races), verify the lock scope covers the full critical section. A lock that
  wraps only the I/O operations but not the read-modify-write transaction
  creates a TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) window.
- **HTTP timeouts**: Any new HTTP call without an explicit timeout will hang
  indefinitely under network failure and block all other CLI invocations that
  depend on the same lock.
- **Credential clearing under failure**: Any path that clears credentials on
  error must verify those credentials are the same credentials that initiated
  the failing request. Clearing credentials that a concurrent process has
  already refreshed is data destruction.

## Step 9: Generate the Mission Review Report

Produce a single structured markdown report. The report is your deliverable.
It must be self-contained — a reader who has not done any of the prior steps
must be able to understand each finding from the report alone.

```markdown
# Mission Review Report: <slug>

**Reviewer**: <your identity>
**Date**: <ISO date>
**Mission**: `<slug>` — <friendly_name>
**Baseline commit**: `<baseline_merge_commit>`
**HEAD at review**: `<git rev-parse HEAD>`
**WPs reviewed**: WP01..WPN

---

## FR Coverage Matrix

| FR ID | Description (brief) | WP Owner | Test File(s) | Test Adequacy | Finding |
|-------|---------------------|----------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| FR-001 | ... | WP01 | tests/init/... | ADEQUATE | — |
| FR-NNN | ... | WPN | — | MISSING | [DRIFT-N] |

**Legend**: ADEQUATE = test constrains the required behavior; PARTIAL = test
exists but uses synthetic fixture that does not match production model;
MISSING = no test found; FALSE_POSITIVE = test passes even when implementation
is deleted.

---

## Drift Findings

### DRIFT-1: <Title>

**Type**: [NON-GOAL INVASION | LOCKED-DECISION VIOLATION | PUNTED-FR | NFR-MISS]
**Severity**: [CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW]
**Spec reference**: <NG-N | D-N | FR-NNN | NFR-NNN>
**Evidence**:
- `git diff <baseline>..HEAD -- <file>` line NNN: `<exact code>`
- Or: absence of expected change in `<file>`

**Analysis**: <Why this is a drift, not a design choice. Cite the spec clause
that is violated or the expected change that is absent.>

---

## Risk Findings

### RISK-1: <Title>

**Type**: [BOUNDARY-CONDITION | ERROR-PATH | DEAD-CODE | CROSS-WP-INTEGRATION]
**Severity**: [CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW]
**Location**: `<file>:<line_range>`
**Trigger condition**: <The specific input or state that activates this risk>

**Analysis**: <What happens when triggered, why it was not caught by existing
tests, and what the user-visible impact is.>

---

## Silent Failure Candidates

List every code path where the implementation returns a default value (empty
string, None, False) rather than raising on a condition that indicates
malfunction.

| Location | Condition | Silent result | Spec impact |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| `src/.../foo.py:42` | `JSONL has no events` | returns `""` | FR-605: changelog block always empty |

---

## Security Notes

| Finding | Location | Risk class | Recommendation |
|---------|----------|------------|----------------|
| ... | ... | [PATH-TRAVERSAL | SHELL-INJECTION | LOCK-TOCTOU | UNBOUND-HTTP | CREDENTIAL-RACE] | ... |

---

## Final Verdict

**PASS** / **PASS WITH NOTES** / **FAIL**

### Verdict rationale

[One paragraph. State whether all FRs are adequately covered, whether any
locked decisions were violated, whether any release-gating NFRs missed their
threshold, whether any security findings are blocking. If FAIL, name the
specific findings that block release.]

### Open items (non-blocking)

[List findings that are not blocking release but should be addressed in a
follow-up mission.]
```

---

## Key Rules

1. **You do not fix anything.** Your role is to document. If you find a bug,
   describe it precisely and note its severity. Do not patch code, do not amend
   tests, do not modify spec artifacts.

2. **Every finding must cite its evidence.** "I believe the test is inadequate"
   is not a finding. "Test at `tests/foo.py:42` creates a synthetic WP with
   `status: done` in frontmatter; real missions store status in
   `status.events.jsonl`; the test would pass if the implementation code were
   deleted" is a finding.

3. **Absence is evidence.** A file that the spec required to change but shows
   no diff is a finding. An FR that has no test hit is a finding. A locked
   decision whose violation was "approved by arbiter" without a rationale is
   a finding.

4. **Read the invisible holes.** The spec states what the system must do. It
   does not state every assumption it relies on. The reviewer's job includes
   surfacing those assumptions and checking whether the implementation honored
   them even though they were never written down.

5. **The review history is signal.** WPs with 3+ rejection cycles or arbiter
   overrides are high-priority targets. The disagreement that caused those
   cycles often reveals an unstated requirement or a design ambiguity that the
   implementation resolved in a way the spec author did not intend.

6. **Tests that pass are not proof.** A test that passes because it uses a
   synthetic fixture, not because the code is correct, is a liability, not an
   asset. The question is always: does this test constrain the actual runtime
   behavior?

7. **Security findings are never "low priority" for release-gating missions.**
   If the mission modifies auth, file locking, subprocess execution, or HTTP
   calls, any security finding that could affect a user in normal operation is
   at minimum MEDIUM severity.

8. **The verdict is binary for blocking findings.** PASS WITH NOTES is for
   non-blocking findings only. If any CRITICAL or HIGH finding exists that is
   not already documented as an accepted known issue, the verdict is FAIL.

9. **This skill does not use any generated review prompt.** Unlike
   `spec-kitty-runtime-review`, which defers to the CLI-generated prompt as
   the source of truth, this skill produces original analysis. The spec and
   contracts are the source of truth.
